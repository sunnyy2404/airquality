    <h1>Decision Tree Regressor</h1>
  <p>Decision-tree algorithm comes under the category of supervised learning algorithms. It works for both continuous as well as categorical output variables.
  Decision tree regression observes features of an object and trains a model in the structure of a tree to predict data in the future to produce meaningful continuous output.

    The final regression result is gained by calculating the mean values of the last split.

    <h1>Random Forest Regressor</h1>
  <p>Random Forest is an ensemble technique capable of performing both regression and classification tasks with the use of multiple decision trees and a technique called Bootstrap and Aggregation, commonly known as bagging. The basic idea behind this is to combine multiple decision trees in determining the final output rather than relying on individual decision trees.

    <h1>XG Boost Regressor</h1>
  <p>XGBoost is a powerful approach for building supervised regression models. The validity of this statement can be inferred by knowing about its (XGBoost) objective function and base learners. The objective function contains loss function and a regularization term. It tells about the difference between actual values and predicted values, i.e how far the model results are from the real values. </p>
